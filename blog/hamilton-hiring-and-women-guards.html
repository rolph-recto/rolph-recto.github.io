<h1 class="title">Hamilton and Hiring Women Guards</h1>
<p>July 05, 2020</p>
<p>I completely missed the <em>Hamilton</em> discourse five years ago,
but in the wake of the movie version’s release, there have been a new
round of takes. Here I’ll give my own. I’m going to skip discussion of
its merits as a play (I enjoyed it quite a bit—sue me) and go directly
to discussing its politics.</p>
<p>You can sum up a lot of leftist criticisms of liberalism with this
meme:</p>
<figure>

alt="Hire Women Guards Meme" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Hire Women Guards Meme</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The joke is that the Democrats are as bad as Republicans, but they
appeal to women and minorities. Instead of working to fundamentally
change institutions and fix their underlying rot, liberals would rather
address identitarian concerns as a kind of band-aid. Instead of
addressing economic concerns, liberals are obssessed with cultural
ones.</p>
<p>This is the <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/opinion/bernie-sanders-protesters-democrats.html">cynical
interpretation</a> of the recent unrest following George Floyd’s murder:
the powers that be can immediately take up the cause of Black Lives
Matter and the broader demands for a reckoning with racism exactly
because, despite their revolutionary airs, the changes they
demand—diversification of elite institutions and its leadership—are not
structural changes. The demands would change what the personnel of these
institutions look like, but not how they run. Calls to “defund the
police” of course does not fit this, but the rest of the broader
happenings around the protests, which have been more successful in
meeting their demands, do revolve around toppling statues, renaming
institutions, firing problematic leaders—indeed, all cultural victories.
We’ve yet to see whether these cultural victories can be leveraged into
<a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/opinion/black-lives-matter-injustice.html">economic
ones</a>.</p>
<p>To be clear, I think this is an overblown interpretation, and there’s
reason to believe that there will be real, substantive <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/07/us/minneapolis-police-abolish.html">reforms</a>
to follow the protests. And identitarian concerns are themselves
important ends that cannot be wholly subordinate to material ends. But
regardless of whether the interpretation is overblown or not,
<em>Hamilton</em> embodies the criticism because it takes the
traditional narrative about the Founding Fathers and gives it a patina
of diversity without challenging its fundamental assumptions. It uses
non-white actors and non-white music to tell a triumphalist story about
how white people founded America.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> It recasts the life of
Hamilton as a “young, scrappy, and hungry” <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNFf7nMIGnE">embodiment of
hip-hop</a>—he grew up poor, immigrated to the big city and became
successful through his own hustle, had intense rivalries with Burr and
Jefferson and the other Founders—to let minorities see that his life and
struggles parallel theirs.</p>
<p>Regardless of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s intentions, his reframing of the
founding has the insidious consequence of legitimizing its traditional
narrative and occluding its real faults. As Lyra Monteiro <a
href="https://ncph.org/history-at-work/its-not-just-a-musical/">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a country in which those of us who are not white men are still
subjected to quotidian discrimination and continue to suffer from the
legacies of our oppression on which the country was founded, to tell
that history in a way that encourages people of color to feel closer to
it only makes it harder for us to see clearly the inequalities that
shape our lives…such a move does, however, work beautifully with the
color-blind ideology promoted by white liberals. This musical is guilty
of many of the same flaws as the vast majority of stories about the
founding era: it glosses over the racism and the sexism involved in the
founding our country, as if these were design flaws, not deliberate
features.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s an argument to be made that <em>Hamilton</em> has been so
massively popular and successful exactly because its politics are so
anodyne and reassuring, that it does not tear down the story of the
founding but instead makes it more superficially inclusive. In that,
it’s a great update of American civic religion. But it’s long past time
to take the narrative of this religion uncritically, one where
minorities play no role in the shaping of its founding, and whose
oppression can be acknowledged as part of this religion and yet does not
fundamentally alter its expression. For those imprisoned into oblivion,
it must be cold comfort to see that their jailers now look like
them.</p>

href="https://online.ucpress.edu/tph/article/38/1/89/90687/Review-Essay-Race-Conscious-Casting-and-the">review
essay</a> goes into extensive detail about the erasure of black people
in the play. This is most notable in the almost complete absence of
slave characters, save for an oblique reference to Sally Hemings. Even
when slavery is mentioned, it mostly serves to highlight the
anti-slavery efforts of white characters, or as a cudgel against
southern landowners, as in Hamilton’s repartees to Jefferson.<a
