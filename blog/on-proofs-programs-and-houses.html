<b>Rolph Recto</b> - <a href="/">Home</a>
<hr />
<h1 class="title">On Proofs, Programs, and Houses</h1>
<p>December 22, 2020</p>
<p>I recently read the (in)famous <a
href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/social.pdf">“Social
Processes” paper</a> that dismissed the then-nascent area of program
verification. Forty years after its publication, there’s still a lot of
things that the paper got right, especially in the assumption of
“continuity” in verifying toy programs to verifying real systems. Of
course, in a world where <a href="https://compcert.org/">CompCert</a>
and <a href="https://sel4.systems/">seL4</a> exist, verification has not
quite died as De Millo, Lipton, and Perlis had expected (or wished), and
these developments show that the authors were overly pessimistic in
their assessment of program verification’s viability.</p>
<p>Also, I found the disanalogy the paper makes between proofs of
mathematical theorems and program verification, from which it draws much
of its rhetorical power, to be misguided. The authors make much hay of
the difference between proofs and verifications, but caring about this
difference betrays a wrong view of the role of verification in software
development. In this post, I will explain why this is the case.</p>
<p>NB: I don’t work in verification, so take what I’m writing as from
the perspective of a lay observer, not an expert!</p>
<h2 id="verifications-are-not-proofs">Verifications are not proofs</h2>
<p>Despite the dream of the formalists, the everyday work of
mathematicians still consists of writing proofs that are very far
removed from a sequence of deductions in, say, a Hilbert-style formal
system.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Their informality means that, as
evidenced by the paper’s summary of erroneous independence proofs in set
theory, it is actually quite common for proofs to be wrong.</p>
<p>But this informality is by design, since proofs are meant to provide
that most mystical of psychological phenomena: <em>intuition</em>. As
the authors beautifully put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he proof of a theorem is a message. A proof is not a beautiful
abstract object with an independent existence. No mathematician grasps a
proof, sits back, and sighs happily at the knowledge that he can now be
certain of the truth of his theorem. He runs out into the hall and looks
for someone to listen to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More than anything, mathematical proofs are inputs to a social
process, where mathematicians read proofs; internalize and paraphase
them in their own words; discuss them with other mathematicians; refute
them and give counterexamples; generalize them; connect them with other
known theorems. A proof alone does not lead to the establishment of some
mathematical fact—rather it is the organic whole of this social process
that leads the mathematical community to believe the fact.</p>
<p>In contrast, compared to their mathematical counterparts,
verifications of programs—then and now—function very poorly as vehicles
for intuition. They are long and tedious, involving endless bits of
shallow reasoning, as anyone who has tried to verify programs in Hoare
logic know. Unlike mathematical proofs, no one really is chomping at the
bit to read how some program was verified:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Verifications are not messages; a person who ran out into the hall to
communicate his latest verification would rapidly fred himself a social
pariah. Verifications cannot really be read; a reader can flay himself
through one of the shorter ones by dint of heroic effort, but that’s not
reading. Being unreadable and—literally—unspeakable, verifications
cannot be internalized, transformed, generalized, used, connected to
other disciplines, and eventually incorporated into a community
consciousness. They cannot acquire credibility gradually, as a
mathematical theorem does; one either believes them blindly, as a pure
act of faith, or not at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="but-theyre-not-meant-to-be">…but they’re not meant to be</h2>
<p>So why bother with verifying programs? Here I think is where the
paper’s argument goes off the rails. The authors’ mistake is to notice
that mathematical proofs and program verifications have the same
form—that of logical reasoning—and from that conclude that they must
have the same function—to provide intuition as part of a social process
whereby a community establishes the correctness of a theorem or a
program. Program verifications <em>do</em> provide reasons to believe a
program is correct, but <em>not</em> by providing intuition for why it
is so.</p>
<p>An analogy might help to explain this. Say you are part of a
construction crew building a house. The owner wants to know whether the
house has been constructed properly, but there’s a lot of fussy details
to ensure this: Is there enough insulation? Are the studs too far apart?
Were the electric wiring and plumbing installed properly? To allay the
owner’s concerns, an inspector goes through the newly constructed house
and makes sure everything is up to code. The inspector provides a
document outlining all the checks that he did, and signs her name to
attest that the house was built properly.</p>
<p>Does the owner need to read the entire document and ruminate on its
contents to believe the house was built properly? No. It’s probably long
and tedious. Mostly likely the owner will just make sure that the
inspector signed the document and indeed attested its veracity. The
function of the document is to get the owner to believe something, but
<em>not</em> primarily by understanding why. Rather, it is a
<em>testimony</em> to some statement, backed by the role of the
inspector in the social process of constructing houses safely. The
testimony of the inspector has power to persuade us because she has
incentives to provide correct testimony in the form of professional and
reputational harms if she doesn’t. If she she signs off on houses that
are poorly built, she will soon lose her certification as an inspector
when other people find out.</p>
<p>Showing the correctness of a theorem involves deep understanding of a
mathematical structure. It’s fun to read proofs a lot of times because
they help make things “click” and align your vision of a structure
properly, like a pair of mental glasses. Verifying a program is not like
this, because <em>a program is less like a theorem and more like a
house</em>.</p>
<p>Showing a program meets some specification is involves checking a lot
of boring, fussy details you need to get right—that the right variable
is incremented by the right amount; that the right function is called
with the right arguments; that the loop guard is right; and so on.
Whereas the inspector might go around the house and check off a list of
specification items the house needs to meet, we might write proofs in
Coq to discharge a set of specification obligations the program needs to
meet. There’s not the aesthetic pleasure of finally having the right
mental picture of a mathematical structure in your mind’s eye that comes
with reading a good proof but rather the tedium of bookkeeping. There is
nothing to really “understand,” no deeper meaning to glean like in a
proof of a theorem. But no one said verifying proofs should be like
proving theorems!</p>
<p>To believe the verification of a program is not to believe it
“blindly, as a pure act of faith,” as the authors put it. To call belief
in verification of a program “blind faith” would be as absurd as calling
trust in the inspector “blind faith”—we have perfectly good reasons for
holding both. Instead of just believing construction workers, which the
owner might be loathe to do, having an inspector sign off on the house
lowers her testimonial burden. She now only has to believe on the
inspector’s good word, on which the inspector’s job relies, instead of
the word of many people. Likewise, the verification of a program lowers
the testimonial burden—or what is usually called the trusted computing
base (TCB)—of believing the correctness of that program. It allows you
to only believe Coq’s kernel, designed to be as simple as possible<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, is implemented correctly to believe
the program is correct. Otherwise, without verification, you have to
believe the entirety of the program was written without error: a much
riskier proposition.</p>
<p>So, to conclude: programs are not like theorems, verifications are
not like proofs—and it is fine that this is the case. The social process
of establishing mathematical knowledge is not the same as the social
process of writing correct and reliable software. Once we rid ourselves
of this spurious analogy, we will have a clearer idea of verification’s
role in software development.</p>
