<h1 class="title">What Are Security Conditions? - An Addendum on
Noninterference</h1>
<p>August 29, 2021</p>
<p>In <a href="/blog/what-are-security-conditions.html">my last blog
post</a>, I argued that noninterference is an inadequate security
condition because many, if not most, secure programs have intentional
information release. A thought that I did not entertain is whether
noninterference can accurate classify programs with no intentional
information release. Is noninterference a necessary and sufficient
condition for such programs?</p>
<p>Let’s approach this question with a concrete example. Here is a bog
standard definition of noninterference for sequential programs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> be a program and <span
class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> be memories that have equivalent
public values. Let running <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> with
<span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> as its initial memory arrive at
final memory <span class="math inline">\(M_1^\prime\)</span> and running
<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> as its initial memory arrive at final
memory <span class="math inline">\(M_2^\prime\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> satisfies noninterference when <span
class="math inline">\(M_1^\prime\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(M_2^\prime\)</span> have equivalent public
values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a program to satisfy this definition, it must not leak the secret
values in its initial memory. But we can easily imagine programs that
satisfy the definition that still leak these secrets. For example:</p>
<pre><code>while (secret &lt; 0) {
  secret--;
}</code></pre>
<p>The program doesn’t read or write public values, so obviously any two
runs that start with the same public values will end with the same
public values as well. This means that the program satisfies
noninterference as stated above. At the same time there’s a clear way
that the program leaks information: the execution time of the program
directly correlates with the value of <code>secret</code>. Thus if the
adversary can measure the execution time, it can glean the value of
<code>secret</code>!</p>
<p>The program above is a classic example of an external timing channel,
a particularly pernicious kind of side channel. The upshot is that
noninterference as stated above is not a sufficient condition for secure
programs with no intentional information release. The definition is,
however, still necessary—all secure programs with no intentional
information release should satisfy it.</p>
<p>Can you patch the definition so it does not admit programs with
timing channels? Here’s the pessimistic take. Definitions of
noninterference are usually given over the operational semantics of a
program. But the operational semantics of a program is nothing but a
model of a program’s execution in an actual machine. We can imagine an
operational semantics with an additional “counter” component that gets
incremented at every step, and a revision of noninterference that
demands that two runs of a program not only have public-equivalent
memories but equal counters at termination. This might work—but now you
have to assume that all steps take the same amount of time, which
ignores things such as cache effects and the <a
href="https://ranjitjhala.github.io/static/subnormal.pdf">inherent
variability</a> between instruction execution times.</p>
<p>In other words, it might lead to a better model, but it is a model
nonetheless, and thus abstracts out some implementation details. But
side effects are all about leaking information through implementation
details! So unless we have a <a
href="https://kwarc.info/teaching/TDM/Borges.pdf">Borgesian</a> model as
exact as the program executing in a real machine, we can’t be sure that
a definition of noninterference has ruled out all possible leaks through
side channels.</p>
<p>This leads us to the conclusion that there are at least two sources
of incompleteness for security conditions—that is, why programs
satisfying such conditions are not necessarily secure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inability to exactly capture intentional information release</li>
<li>Inability to capture all possible side channels through which
information can be leaked</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s zoom out to the bigger picture. Assume that any intentional
information release you would want to have in a secure program can be
captured approximately as a “relaxed” security condition (i.e. a
security condition that, unlike noninterference, allows for intentional
information release). Then we can visualize the space of programs as
follows.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../files/secure-programs.png"
alt="Sets of secure programs and programs satisfying security conditions" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Sets of secure programs and programs
satisfying security conditions</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Let’s go down the sets from largest to smallest. The first set is the
set of programs that satisfy relaxed security conditions—i.e., given the
set of relaxed security conditions <span
class="math inline">\(SC\)</span> and set of programs <span
class="math inline">\(P_{c}\)</span> that satisfy a particular relaxed
security condition <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, then the
largest set is <span class="math inline">\(\bigcap_{c \in SC}
P_c\)</span>. The second set is the set of all secure programs,
including those with intentional information release. The third set is
the set of programs satisfying some definition of noninterference.
Finally, the fourth set is the set of secure programs with no
intentional information release.</p>
<p>The second and fourth sets classifying secure programs are “fuzzy”,
in that we have no formal way of characterizing such sets the way we do
for the first and third sets, which classify programs that satisfy some
security conditions. Two of the big research programs in language-based
security is to more and more accurately characterize the second and
fourth sets by way of the first and third sets. As we get better and
better at characterizing intentional information release, the first set
gets smaller and approaches the second set. As our operational models
get better and better at capturing side channels that can leak
information in programs, the third set gets smaller and approaches the
fourth set. I doubt that the first and second sets and the third and
fourth sets respectively will ever coincide, but it is fruitful research
nonetheless to try.</p>
