<h1 class="title">You can’t stop cancel culture</h1>
<p>August 23, 2020</p>
<p>There’s been another <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/19/us/politics/aaron-coleman-kansas.html">wave</a>
of cancel culture discourse following the <a
href="https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/">Harper’s
letter</a>, so here’s my take on it.</p>
<p>There’s a series of rhetorical evasions that I’ve seen people perform
whenenver the topic of cancelling comes up. The first is to say that
cancel culture doesn’t exist; or if it does exist, the person cancelled
deserved it; or if the person didn’t deserve it, then it doesn’t happen
that often and very act of discussing it, which is taken to be a
“symbolic” problem, makes you blind to real problems at hand.</p>
<p>I think these people make these evasions because of some
uncomfortable resonances cancellation has with other things they clearly
don’t like. Calling someone’s boss to complain about something that
person did outside of their job is prototypical “Karen” behavior—and no
one wants to think themselves of being a Karen. Of course, <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/26/us/central-park-video-dog-video-african-american-trnd/index.html">Amy
Cooper calling the cops</a> is especially egregious, but it is of a
piece with trying to get someone fired.</p>
<p>The other, darker parallel you can make to cancelling is that it is
an attempt to enact moral instruction using the market. You cancel
someone to teach them a lesson, and for the lesson to stick they need to
be humiliated in public, and to lose their livelihood. But this is the
same principle that animates the push for means-testing in welfare
programs, or for dismantling the welfare state altogether. Being on the
government dole as “welfare queens” without incentive to look for work
is a concern conservatives have that leftists see as an excuse to leave
people in poverty. If we don’t like poor people to be taught by the
market that they are lazy and only through grit can they rise above
their station, why should we think that cancelling people and having
them fired would make them learn to have the right opinions?</p>
<p>Also: sure, the people loudest about the dangers of cancelling seem
to be doing just fine—the Harper’s letter signatories seem to be doing
quite well!—or seem to center it as <em>the</em> most important crisis
of the culture when there are obviously bigger and more important
problems around. But regardless of what we think of the messengers, it
is hard to deny the message is true, and that there have <a
href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/06/why-did-the-washington-post-get-this-woman-fired.html">been</a>
<a
href="https://twitter.com/SwipeWright/status/1281793002986336256">plenty</a>
<a
href="https://www.insider.com/gillian-philip-childrens-author-sacked-tweeting-support-jk-rowling-2020-7">of</a>
<a
href="https://www.vox.com/2020/7/29/21340308/david-shor-omar-wasow-speech">cases</a>
to point to as examples of real, legitimate cancellations. People in
precarous positions have been fired—this is not a “symbolic
problem.”</p>
<p>Maybe people fear that admitting cancellations happen would give
license to the people who are loudest in decrying them and would fuel
their histrionics which seem to be clearly motivated by less than noble
reasons of defending free speech. Maybe Bari Weiss or Bret Stephens have
a point, but they’re still blowhards. But I don’t think it’s really that
big of a bullet to bite. To deny cancel culture exists is to effectively
deny that people try to get other people fired for having bad opinions.
But put in that way, it’s obvious that cancel culture is real—it’s real
in an almost banal way. It’s not a recent phenomenon, but something that
has probably been going on since people had bosses to whom people can
yell about their behavior. People like to complain, bosses don’t want
the headache of bad publicity, and if there’s an easy scapegoat to make
the problem go away, they get the axe. Hard to deny that’s real!
Furthermore, this is an ecumenical phenomenon, something that groups of
people have done forever, not just something particular to the
contemporary left. Here’s where I remind you that the Dixie Chicks
exist.</p>
<p>The only feature that is recent about cancel culture is its
manifestation in social media, which I think has two effects. It’s now
much <a
href="https://twitter.com/heideggrrrl/status/1282864014436044800">easier</a>
to have lots of random people can band together and call your work,
harass your boss, and so on. And, yes, maybe this has exacerbated the
situation, and being cancelled in the age of the internet happens more
frequently and with greater intensity than before. The second effect is
that cancellation is now more public: as <a
href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/vox/the-ezra-klein-show/e/75794632">Ezra
Klein points out</a>, cancellations happened in the past, in meetings
behind closed doors, but the idea of “cancel culture” can only be
possible once we can witness it happening. So even if online discourse
has indeed intensified the problem of cancellation, it has also probably
exaggerated it.</p>
<p>But I’ll bracket that point for now. The real answer that you can
make to the Bari Weisses of the world is that they are fighting cancel
culture the wrong way. You can’t stop cancel culture: it’s an informal,
distributed process, not a formal legal process. You can’t talk to the
manager of a cancel mob even as they might be talking to your manager.
It’s intensified by technology in the way that technology, in its
instrumental way, makes a lot of things easier to do. You can’t stop
random people from calling your boss, and as tweet begets tweet<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, it’s even harder to stop a Twitter
mob. It’s also quite optimistic to assume we can achieve consensus on
what constitutes harmful speech. So for any particular thing that you
might say or write, there will always be some people who find it harmful
and complain to your boss about it.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to be fatalistic by pointing out this fact. Rather,
consider: even if you try to make the definition of harmful speech as
exacting as possible, what happens to those who get cancelled for speech
that is very clearly harmful? To put too fine a point on it: what
happens to Holocaust deniers? Clearly they should be shunned from polite
society, and we should make no accomodations for their speech. But
should they just not get a job so they starve and die?</p>
<p>To really stop cancel culture, it is not enough to expand the Overton
window, or to minimize the boundaries of harmful speech. People will
keep cancelling, and some of the cancelled will not deserve it. Rather,
the real solution is to make people <em>uncancellable</em>—to make it so
that the brouhaha over their bad opinions can’t prevent their access to
fundamental goods that should be guaranteed for everyone. This means an
end to at-will employment and employer-based healthcare, at the very
least. Who cares if people yell at your boss about you, when you know
that you can’t be fired just to make it go away? Even if you do get
fired, you can be sure that you still have access to health care.</p>
<p>This move will have the double effect of ending the chilling effect
that people worry so much about cancellations, and will advance the
project of the left to secure goods through universal programs. It’s a
win-win situation. The tiresome debates about “open discourse” can end,
because the problem that the Harper’s letter signatories are complaining
about would then be truly symbolic. Or they can continue, but as being
purely the free play of meaningless chatter online—as all online chatter
should be.</p>
