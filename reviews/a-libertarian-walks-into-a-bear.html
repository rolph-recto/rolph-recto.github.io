<h1 class="title">A Libertarian Walks Into a Bear by Matthew
Honglitz-Hetling</h1>
<p>December 23, 2020</p>
<p>A funny, Bill-Bryson-esque look into a small town in New Hampshire.
The humor mostly works, but I got the sense that Honglitz-Hetling was
self-consciously hamming up the text to force a laugh, which somewhat
detracts from the actual funny bits.</p>
<p>The story of the Free Town Project in Grafton confirms my suspicions
of libertarians, who, instead of the logic-obssessed principled people
that they see themselves as being, are actually just people who want to
be unfettered by the usual constraints of propriety that the rest of us
subject ourselves to for the purpose of community and solidarity. There
is nothing logical about refusing to pay taxes to fund firefighting
services for one’s community, when so many houses have been burned: it
is selfishness masking itself as stringent application of first
principles. Defecting in a prisoners’ dilemma—indeed, taking care of you
and yours with not even a hint of realizing that you are indeed in a
prisoners’ dilemma—is not rational.</p>
<p>Honglitz-Hetling depicts the bleakness of this selfish attitude
particularly well with Jessica Soule, who becomes a shut-in after an
frightful encounter with a bear. Her isolation was furthered by the fact
that the road in front of her house stopped being plowed during the
winter, because no one wanted to pay for road maintenance. The fact that
Grafton seems so tepid and lifeless compared to its neighboring towns
like Canaan also reflects the libertarian spirit of putting oneself
above all else. They might try to ape forming communities, but when it
matters, you cannot be sure that your fellow libertarians will have your
back. The freedom that libertarians are working themselves toward is a
perverse kind of freedom, one where you can do whatever you want, but
ultimately left destitute in want of cooperation.</p>
<p>Hobbes famously described the state of nature, the state of human
society without government, as being “nasty, brutish, and short.” As it
turns out, the state of nature is also populated by quite a few
bears.</p>
