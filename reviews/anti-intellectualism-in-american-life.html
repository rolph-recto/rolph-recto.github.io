<h1 class="title">Anti-Intellectualism in American Life by Richard
Hofstadter</h1>
<p>April 01, 2017</p>
<p>From reading Hofstadter’s Anti-Intellectualism in American Life,
there’s a pretty unmistakable relationship between democratic sentiment
and anti-intellectualism. In pretty much all social conflicts he
presents in the book, the intellectuals are from the upper-class, are
seen as effeminate and alien, more akin to decadent Europe than
practical America. And the ones that have the most invective against
pursuits of the mind often do so from the vantage of populism.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the Great Awakening, the evangelicals (e.g. Methodists and
Baptists) were seen as democratic because they cared little for doctrine
and emphasized over it the subjective experience of religious feeling;
and instead of leaving proselytizing to the clergy, they allowed anyone
willing to preach.</p></li>
<li><p>The pushback against civil service reformers from introducing
entrance exams (like those in Prussia or China) to positions in the
governmental bureaucracy</p></li>
<li><p>Farmers resisting (and resenting) the experiments and new
techniques by scientists, and resisting the formation of agricultural
and technical colleges (e.g. against Morrill’s land grants for such
institutions)</p></li>
<li><p>Within the labor movement, the rank-and-file’s uneasy partnership
with professionals (e.g. lawyers and economists) and their desire to
procure their leaders from promotions within the rank-and-file.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The simplest and most obvious explanation for this division is that
in the past education was mainly in the purview of the wealthy only, so
that pushback against intellectualism is part and parcel of class
struggle. It’s not so obvious that’s what is happening now in
contemporary American culture, where attending college is no longer the
privilege of just the wealthy, and is no longer associated with just
classical liberal arts. The modern university has many schools and
fulfills myriad social functions, and for good or ill a large fraction
of young Americans passes through its gates. Yet while for the most part
college attendance and class are divorced (though being a WASP
graduating from Philips Exeter still helps with Harvard admissions),
anti-intellectualism continues unabated, if not fed by the current
technological millieu and transmuted into something even worse
(e.g. fake news). What gives? Attenuate the focus of the university into
non-intellectual pursuits, then it is unclear if the academy is itself a
bastion of the mind. (College is for job preparation, didn’t you
know?)</p>
<p>And by anti-intellectualism I’m excluding here the
industrial-academic complex of the sciences. As long as the sciences
bear useful things the public supports them at least in the abstract if
not the specifics of funding. It’s mostly the liberal arts and the
humanities that bear the brunt of this anti-intellectualism, being
scholastic in focus and bearing no fruit other than finger-wagging to
the larger culture.</p>
<p>Not to say that finger-wagging is necessarily a bad thing; but it
should be easy to see that the average person is more willing to extend
warmth to the academic whose work doesn’t involve criticism of his
beliefs of his way of life. Talk to an astronomer, and you’ll find out
about unbelievable things like supermassive black holes and quasars,
awe-inspiring things whose remote existence has nothing to do with your
life and therefore cannot threaten it. Talk to a humanities professor
and he’ll tell you all the ways that your actions are microaggressions;
how you are contributing to the oppression of minorities, no matter your
good intentions or morals; how the television shows and movies you watch
and the music you listen to are terrible. Is it really then that
surprising that anti-intellectualism is still alive, when there are so
many within the academy unwilling to detach themselves from the bubble
they have ensconced, when those who are in a position to enrich public
discourse refuse to do so in the name of keeping their intellectual
purity, of keeping their noble, tragic sense that they’re right but
perpetually misunderstood or unheard?</p>
