<h1 class="title">Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates</h1>
<p>October 23, 2017</p>
<p>An impressionistic, personal take on What It Means To Be Black in
America Today. Coates is clearly has an incredible gift as a writer, and
actually I think that’s part of the problem. This is not a book of
sociological facts but rather the phenomenology of blackness. And with
that phenomenology comes the attendant problems of seeing the world
through the eyes of one person. Coates is an atheist who fixates on the
“plunder of the black body” precisely because he cannot countenance any
higher reality in which this plunder might be redressed. The arc of
history is not long: there is simply no arc, there is no bending towards
justice. His fatalism can transmute into nihilism at points (e.g. the
famous 9/11 passage). But in a sense it is fitting: this is not a book
for you or me, it is a book for his son. And he would be remiss as a
father to salve his son’s fear with a Christian hope that he himself
does not possess.</p>
<p>I think his voice is an important one to listen to. But I am wary
that the people who need to think about these things will fixate solely
on the emotive aspects of what Coates is saying to the detriment of the
more productive things that can be addressed. It’s comforting in a way,
to listen to his words as a kind of bloodletting, because it makes you
feel like you are a Good Person just merely for listening to his words.
The plunder of the black body: it is an evanescent thing, both nowhere
and everywhere at once. Therefore like air you can forget it is even
present, it has no materiality in your everyday transactions, save for
what you see on the news. Yes, it is slavery, it is redlining, it is
Trayvon Martin and Eric Garner and Tamir Rice and Michael Brown. But
what you remember is Coates’s poesy.</p>
<p>Of course he didn’t mean this, but by being so lyrical, personal, and
emotive, <em>Between the World and Me</em> accidentally does I think
function as a salve for the Dreamers, as he would call them, who might
feel a tinge of guilt about their dreaming and their inaction. There is
no call for concrete action in this book, only the projection of pain
and suffering into beautiful words. And that is in itself an important
thing! To turn pain into art is a timeless human activity. But it only
goes so far, and it is less about changing the world so that the pain is
ameliorated but rather to express this pain and communicate it, to make
it alive to others. And what beautiful pain, beautiful words, does
Coates wring out of his blackness. And maybe this will inspire action in
others. I am pessimistic: thus the liberal conscience, having read
Coates, has achieved Awareness, and can move on to the next problem with
which it can be Aware.<Paste></p>
