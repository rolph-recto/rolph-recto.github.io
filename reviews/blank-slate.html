<h1 class="title">The Blank Slate by Steven Pinker</h1>
<p>July 24, 2015</p>
<p>This is a great popular science book. Pinker is a lucid writer with a
style that is always engaging. As far as the content, this is a
fantastic synthesis of a large number of works within cognitive science,
especially evolutionary and social psychology. He summarizes works by
other authors very well – I found the “Hot Button” chapters especially
effective in this. I wished he included a capsule primer on evolutionary
psychology, from whose literature he cites throughout the book, as he
did for behavioral genetics in the chapter on children.</p>
<p>I’m less enthusiastic about the parts of the book where Pinker
tackles politics, philosophy and art. He really does hate Marxism, even
going so far as to compare it with Nazism! While there might be an
argument that belief in the Blank Slate undergirds Marxist philosophy
and thus partially provided justification for totalitarian communist
regimes—the choice quote from Mao of painting the “beautiful blank
canvas” of humanity comes to mind here—he runs roughshod on subtleties
here, and veers almost into caricature. The same criticisms apply to his
discussion of “radical scientists,” his favored term of abuse for
academics like Gould and Lewontin with whom he as political
disagreements. While his criticisms of blending politics and science are
spot on—“dialectical biology,” anyone?—the discussion is so one-sided,
so focused on evisceration, that it makes one think that Pinker’s take
isn’t the most charitable and unbiased one.</p>
<p>The chapter on Art was probably the weakest part of the book. For all
his calls to a reconciliation between the two cultures, it betrays
Pinker’s great arrogance that he thinks he can discount modernist and
pomo art so glibly since, he argues, it relies on a faulty view of human
nature. Sure, some of his criticisms—none of them new—are valid, but I
find that deriding an artistic and literary movement using evolutionary
psychology is exactly the kind of thing that makes humanities professors
suspicious of scientists who claim they aren’t trying to start a turf
war. (And it’s sweet irony that he uses Vonnegut’s “Harrison Bergeson”
as one of the overtures in the “Voices of the Species” chapter when
Vonnegut’s work is squarely in the pomo tradition that he dislikes.) His
psychologizing of people in modern art circles is partly true,
probably—the race to shock the public by certain artists is a race for
status, as is the performative impulse within certain circles of the
academy to write impenetrably to signal depth of thought—but again, he
fails to take seriously what he is criticizing.</p>
