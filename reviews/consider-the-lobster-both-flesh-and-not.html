<h1 class="title">Consider the Lobster and Both Flesh and Not by David
Foster Wallace</h1>
<p>January 07, 2018</p>
<h2 id="consider-the-lobster">Consider the Lobster</h2>
<p>An aside on DFW: I did not care for <em>Broom of the System</em> at
all, because I thought its thoroughgoing pomo-ness was nothing more than
a ploy for DFW to sound smart and make a novel centered around
Wittgenstein’s philosophy. His characters are cardboard cutouts in the
same way Vonnegut’s characters are, but without any of the emotional
resonsance that the latter chose deliberately to have characters like
that. Vonnegut’s characters were “listless playthings of forces beyond
their understanding”–Broom of the System’s were…expressly linguistic
creations? It’s trying to grasp at something really abstract that is
depressing in its cynicism–you’re just like a character in the book,
don’t ya know, whose existence is mediated completely by language?–and
not convincingly true. (I have a body unmediated by language, and this
defines large parts of what I consider myself. Maybe this is news to a
philosophy undergrad in his Cartesian solipsism.) There is no moment
like the firebombing of Dresden to hang this idea. This has made me
allergic to reading his fiction, and hence why, outside of it being a
hassle and all to read a Big Important Book, I haven’t bothered to read
Infinite Jest.</p>
<p>With that said, the DFW of his nonfiction does seem like a genuine,
normal dude, smart and curious and a great tour guide of late 90s-early
2000s America, footnotes on footnotes notwithstanding. Maybe I have to
give DFW a pass for Broom of the System since after all he was just an
undergrad when he wrote it.</p>
<h3 id="up-simba">Up, Simba</h3>
<p>Reading this in 2018 makes inescapable the comparison between McCain
and Trump. Both were self-styled straighttalkers and no-bullshitters, in
their own way. But the tension that DFW finds in McCain, between the
parts of him that seem like the genuine article (being a POW at Hua Lo,
his unwavering professionalism at town hall meetings) and those that
make him seem like a calculating salesman (staging the phone call with
the kid so that the techs can record the first 10 seconds of it only)
Trump resolves in, really, an unprecedented way. Unlike Real Leaders who
are also consummate Salesmen, Trump is only a Salesman. He seems not
like a politician because to be a politician is to always live with this
tension, regardless of whether you are a Real Leader or not. At that
particular political moment, fresh with cynicism from the Lewinsky
scandal, DFW found it hard to tell whether McCain is a Real Leader. What
Trump showed us is that if you’re naked enough in your self-interest,
naked enough in saying bullshit, you resolve this Leader-Salesman
tension that so defines politicians that you seem to be a Leader to
people even though you’re transparently just a Salesman, exactly because
you seem so unlike a politician.</p>
<p>Is it because we’re in an unprecedented era of American politics? Is
this an inherent flaw in democracy, that demagogues can get away with
lying because they are so naked about their lying, untethered by moral
compunction or any sense of decency, that this gives them an advantage
over regular politicians who might bother with such things? Is the worry
over partisanship and decency just pearl-clutching, complaints made by
people who are themselves responsible for the degradation they are
lamenting (Democrats; anti-Trump Republicans like Ben Sasse) or have we
truly lost something valuable and ineffable since the 2016 election
cycle? Perhaps it’s both? For the same reasons DFW found it hard to tell
whether the McCain is the genuine article or not, I find the answers to
these questions elusive.</p>
<h2 id="both-flesh-and-not">Both Flesh and Not</h2>
<p>Continuing discussion of DFW in general, since apparently I’m just
going to read all of his nonfiction this week. His writing has an
everyman quality that makes it so fun to read. It’s like hearing some
regular dude, who might be a bit persnicketty with grammar and form,
bullshit about whatever. Reading his essays is like smoking with the
college roommate you wish you’d had.</p>
<p>His style—teeming with Latinisms, initialisms, and of course those
damn footnotes—is inimitable and immediately recognizable. It’s not like
he’s writing in the Academese that he so despises—his style is not as
highfalutin or muddy as that. But it does betray a kind of
hyperliterateness that still positions him as being above the reader. It
stands in tension with the otherwise everyman quality of the writing.
Maybe DFW really is just quite particular about his writing form, and
that inhaling the dictionary really just makes the first word that pops
to his mind longer than usual. In which case, though I find it a little
distracting, still doesn’t really deter from the content too much. Or
maybe he wrote like this deliberately: but for what reason I can’t
countenance.</p>
