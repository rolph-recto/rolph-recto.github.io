<h1 class="title">Crossroads by Jonathan Franzen</h1>
<p>October 27, 2021</p>
<p>Easily the best book of Franzen’s that I’ve read. As <a
href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/11/jonathan-franzen-crossroads/620176/">Becca
Rothfeld points out</a>, he has ditched the “systems novel” structure of
his previous books and has instead laser-focused on what he does best:
chronicling the disintegration of Midwestern families, reaching
something universal through very particular lives. It’s not as if the
“systems” are completely gone either: Russ’s concern for social justice,
his service ministry to an Black church in inner-city Chicago and his
longstanding relationship with the Navajos in Arizona, has Franzen
venturing deftly into racial politics. But they are definitively
backgrounded in the saga of the Hildebrandts.</p>
<p>This shift in focus results in a book shorn of satire, with a love
for its characters that in previous books would have been occupied
instead by smirking disdain. Franzen does not shirk away from describing
how screwed up these people are—how pathetic Russ is in the throes of
his libido, the depths of Perry’s addiction (crescendoed by a harrowing
setpiece in the Navajo reservation), Marion’s curdled self-hatred (and
subsequent escape from it, chain-smoking and all), Becky’s newfound
religiosity covering her fundamental selfishness and self-righteousness,
Clem’s hatred of his father’s weakness resulting in a vagabond
existence. But the book is so animated by its characters’ obsessions and
struggles with being good that it is hard not to fall for them and their
very ordinary humanness. With that, <em>Crossroads</em> is a great
success and an enormous pleasure to read.</p>
<p><a
href="https://newrepublic.com/article/163898/jonathan-franzen-moralist-crossroads-review">Maggie
Doherty</a> puts forth the idea that Franzen gives a a partial solution
to the central question in the book: to be good requires connection with
the physical and a retreat from the obsession with the question itself.
This she thinks is evidenced by Russ’s experience with the Navajos and
Clem’s experience with the Peruvians, both of whom are too taxed with
the daily physical struggles of life to ask themselves if they are being
good; as well as Russ and Marion’s reconciliation by having sex. Doherty
thinks this is a cop-out; I don’t think Franzen meant it to be a
“solution” at all. Can’t it simply be another way that these characters
cope? It’s not as if Russ or Clem really experienced a sort of spiritual
awakening being strangers in strange lands—if anything Russ experienced
a <em>sexual</em> awakening in the reservation, while Clem returns to
New Prospect shorn of his moral absolutism but still in thrall with
incestuous feeling for Becky. And Russ and Marion’s reconciliation
through sex is really about Marion overcoming her self-hatred more than
anything. I think Doherty is doing Franzen a disservice to say that he
is posing any kind of solution: as she notes, he takes as his task as a
writer to depict “mystery through manners,” in Flannery O’Connor’s
rendition. Mystery by its nature precludes any sort of pat solution.</p>
