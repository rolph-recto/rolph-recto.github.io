<h1 class="title">Lightning Rods by Helen DeWitt</h1>
<p>July 28, 2018</p>
<p>This is a technically perfect book. It’s as if Swift took “A Modest
Proposal” and instead of just <em>proposing</em> eating staving Irish
babies, he wrote a novel about a guy who actually starts a company doing
it. What’s even more terrifying about this book is that the Modest
Proposal here is clearly a satirical thing but at the same time you can
see someone going through the logic of actually thinking it to be a good
idea. Whereas Swift’s main goal for his Proposal is to shock, here
DeWitt indicts the culture that could make her Proposal seem so
plausible, if not in the actual content but in the spirit.</p>
<p>I’m reminded of one of Liz Bruenig’s columns where she argues that
capitalism is a Dark Satanic Mill that grinds everything into its logic
of monetary exchange. DeWitt apes the vacuous, mind-numbing American
optimism in business to make that point here. And the best/worst thing
is that it’s not like Lightning Rods solves the putative problem it was
invented for: women still complained about feeling degraded and
disrespected on the job. The difference is that <em>they were paid for
it</em>, and thus we have nothing else to say about it, no moral
language to indict the action, since it’s exchange between consenting
adults, no? If you agreed to a job and its attendant responsibilities,
you have no room to complain.</p>
<p>On the other hand: Lightning Rods had a positive impact for those who
availed of its services and those it employed. Renee and Lucille got
through school debt-free from their extra earnings, and what they
learned on the job (whipping a bare butt taught Lucille to have a killer
instinct!) helped them in the future. DeWitt copies the same
aspirational language that people use to discuss their careers and uses
it here to talk about doing something fucked up, to show that that
aspirational language is in fact veneer to hide the dark, amoral heart
of careerism: the Dark Satanic Mill grinds your deepest longings and
dreams and spits out something beautiful, positive, and ultimately
hollow and disgusting. The Dark Satanic Mill runs and runs, creates
solutions to problems it itself has created (e.g. offering lightning
rod-free temps!), and gives a narrative trajectory of ostensible success
and achievement to one’s life. It is a false religion, a golden calf.
And yet we cannot turn away from the god we worship.</p>
<p>You can read this book as a feminist book, how the world kowtows to
male desire to the effacement of everything else, but really I think
this is more of a Marxist book, one that takes the logic of
commodification to its conclusion, to show that the myriad ways we’ve
complacently accepted that logic in our lives has a darkness at its core
that we ultimately cannot accept, even if we pay no mind to it in small
doses everyday. There are some things to which we place infinite value,
that is not fungible, that is not amenable to exchange. This book is a
reminder of that fact.</p>
