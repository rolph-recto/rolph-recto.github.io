<b>Rolph Recto</b> - <a href="/">Home</a>
<hr />
<h1 class="title">Mind and Cosmos by Thomas Nagel</h1>
<p>October 03, 2015</p>
<p>The subtitle of this book is fighting words, but gladly the pitch of
Nagel’s writing is not at all antagonistic, even if it is incredibly
cavalier. His main point is that the existence of three distinct
phenomena—consciousness, cognition, value—must be taken as challenges to
the prevailing metaphysics of the scientific consensus, what he calls
the “Materialist Neo-Darwinian Conception of Nature.”</p>
<p>This conception of nature has its premise that all there is are
whatever the entities of that the best theories from physics postulate,
and everything about these entities can be captured in timeless
mathematical laws. At the higher levels<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
this includes the phenomenon of life and consciousness: natural
selection (and other selective forces) explains the historical
progression of inorganic chemicals to organic ones, and from these to
life, and from these to conscious beings.</p>
<p>This is the metaphysical doctrine that Nagel attacks, accusations of
his creating a straw-man notwithstanding. Central to his argument is the
notion of intelligibility: the universe somehow evolved beings who can
have a grip, in the form of our scientific theories, at its immensely
complicated structure. The world is intelligible because we can, in
succint and elegant laws, explain how it works. Intelligibility is the
ideal in the sciences, and how a theory makes the phenomena in question
seem <em>inevitable</em> is a mark of its power. By this criterion,
natural selection at its present form is a poor theory, for its
explanation for consciousness, cognition and value makes the existence
of these phenomena a forbiddingly remote possibility. That the laws of
physics entail in the possibility of these is no explanation for their
actuality. To apply the criterion of intelligibility consistently, we
must look for something else.</p>
<p>For Nagel, this something else is his postulation of <em>teleological
laws</em>. He thinks that, given that the laws of physics are
probabilistic, these teleological laws nudge the probabilities, making
the development of life and conscious beings more likely, so that the
universe advances “towards the marvelous.” So he sees natural selection
as not flawed but rather incomplete.</p>
<p>This is not a crazy book, as some reviews of it decry. One has to at
some level admire Nagel’s brazeness for bucking politics and the
consensus of secular intellectuals. Although at first blush it seems
like Nagel is defending some form of intelligent design, he is very
explicitly denies such a claim in the beginning of the book. He is a
staunch atheist, and while he is defending a notion of design in the
natural world he is not, by his own lights, defending intelligent
design. Whether this book is one of the first in shifting the tides
against neo-Darwinian materialism, as he claims, is left to be seen.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Nagel does not talk much about inter-theoretic
reduction, but he seems to think that the consensus in the scientific
community is that such a reduction is in the offing. This is unclear,
and there is a lot of work showing that such a reduction is not
possible, in principle (Fodor 1974). Reduction isn’t central to his
points, however.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"
