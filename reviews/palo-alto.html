<h1 class="title">Palo Alto by Malcolm Harris</h1>
<p>July 08, 2023</p>
<p>This is a sprawling mess of a book that takes Palo Alto the city and
uses it as a symbol of all the ills that capitalism has wrought. Harris
takes the “Palo Alto System,” originally Leland Stanford’s innovative
program for breeding thoroughbreds, as the original articulation of the
ethos that pervades the companies revolving around the university which
bears his late son’s name, as well as the students who study in its
halls. (The System might be the <em>original articulation</em>, but
Harris begins the book with the California Gold Rush, which can be seen
as the <em>origin</em> of the ethos). In the System, colts are trotted
young to determine quickly which of them are born to be good racehorses.
It does not matter that some of the colts are injured in the process;
the System only cares to maximizes profit. Capitalists in Silicon Valley
function the same way: they find early companies to invest in (to “trot
young,” so to speak), and these companies “move fast and break things”
to maximize profit. Harris also chronicles various Stanford academics’
forays into eugenics as a quest to find young talent to cultivate as
part and parcel of this System.</p>
<p>Despite its title, the book strangely does not actually have much to
say about Palo Alto the city. The beginning chapters cover Leland
Stanford and the city’s founding in great detail, but in the main the
narrative is propelled by histories of economic development, companies
and Stanford University’s involvement in the military-industry complex,
not the actual development of the city from Stanford’s farm to the heart
of Silicon Valley. In Harris’s telling, Palo Alto the city remains a
vague, suburban sketch. This vague impression of Palo Alto one is left
with after reading the book points to a bigger problem. <em>Palo
Alto</em> is self-consciously a big book of Marxist history, and it
beats you over the head with its message. Which is fine—it’s a message
that is hard to argue with given what Harris covers. But the problem is
that the structure of the book—or lack thereof—suffers for this
browbeating. <em>Palo Alto</em> reads as if from the perspective of the
angel of history, watching as the “pile of debris before him grows
skyward,” except the storm blowing the angel to the future is not
Progress but rather Capitalism. Harris invites us to sift through the
pile of debris wrought by capitalism with scattershot profiles of
companies, entrepreneurs, and investors, but one wonders if there is a
more inviting, less disorienting way to structure Harris’s compelling
narrative.</p>
<p>In the closing chapter of the book Harris makes the case for
returning Stanford University’s lands to the Ohlone indigenous to the
Bay Area. The thrust of the argument is that Stanford has been the
origin of so many of capitalism’s ills that giving its land to the
Ohlone would be a way of repairing the damage—not just to those
oppressed and immiserated by capitalism but also to the environment. But
with this argument he conflates rectifying the historical injustices
that America as a settler state have inflicted on the Ohlone with their
ability to be better environmental stewards of the Stanford lands. It
might be the case that they would be better stewards; but citing the
actions of indigenous activists (read: a small slice of the indigenous
population) seems rather flimsy evidence to make such a case. So
Harris’s romantic depiction of the Ohlone smacks more than a little of
the Noble Savage trope.</p>
