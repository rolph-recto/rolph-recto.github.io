<h1 class="title">Red Plenty by Francis Spufford</h1>
<p>July 16, 2021</p>
<p>The structure of this book reminds me of Olga Tokarczuk’s
<em>Flights</em>, which she describes as a constellation novel: a
sequence of interconnected stories. The story of the book is, as it
proclaims in the first paragraph, the “story of an idea,” and as a
consequence of that the characters here, as memorable as they are, are
all bit players to the real protagonist, the central planning system of
the Soviet Union. (Is it a novel? The very first sentence of the book
says no, but I think it most clearly is. Clearly Spufford consciously
worked in the liminal space between fiction and history, but you
encounter the characters in the book <em>as</em> characters, not as
people who lived a long time ago, however much that is true.) The book
takes us from the upper echelons of the Politburo, to the eggheads at
Gosplan, to the factory foremans, to the smooth-talking buyers, to the
academics ensconced in a seeming intellectual paradise in
<em>Akademgorodok</em>. And what drives this panoramic tour of mid-20th
century USSR is the sense that the dream of the Khruschev era getting
more and more deferred, the Party’s promise that the USSR will be the
richest country on Earth by 1980 slowly being forgotten—to the point
where someone dug up old government documents from a time capsule and
got in trouble for them! The book is an elegy to this beautiful dream of
a society where everyone will be provided for.</p>
<p>An interesting thing to think about is how <em>Red Plenty</em> would
be different if the dream of fully automatic luxury communism is still
alive today. Would the obsession with cybernetics be replaced with
machine learning? Instead of reams and reams of folders in Gosplan,
would we see humming datacenters crunching all sorts of economic
information? Importantly, given that we have technology far more
advanced than any of the Soviet economists and engineers have dreamt of,
would the slow failure of central planning be instead replaced with its
triumph? It would be a nice thought, that communism simply was an idea
ahead of its time, ironically proving Marx’s historical materialism
correct.</p>
<p>Some of my favorite scenes:</p>
<p>Kantorovich’s beatific vision of Red Plenty in the tram:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He gazed up the tram, and saw everything and everybody in it touched
by the transformation to come, rippling into new and more generous
forms, the number 34 rattlebox to Krestovsky Island becoming a sleek
silent ellipse filled with golden light, the women’s clothes all turning
to quilted silk, the military uniforms melting into tailored grey and
silver: and faces, faces the length of the car, relaxing, losing the
worry lines and the hungry looks and all the assorted toothmarks of
necessity. He could help to do that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Khruschev marveling at a hot dog stand in Manhattan and thinking
about how America has the same idea to bring about prosperity as the
USSR: make lots and lots of cheap stuff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the Americans got it. Of all the capitalist countries, it was
America that hand-most nearly trying to do the same thing as the Soviet
Union. They shared the Soviet insight. They understood that whittling
and hand-stitching belonged to the past. They understood that if
ordinary people were to live the way the kings and merchants of old had
lived, what would be required was a new kind of luxury, an ordinary
luxury built up from goods turned out by the million so that everybody
could have one. And they were so good at it! The bulk fertility of their
industry was only the start. They had a kind of genius for lining up the
fruitfulness of mass production with people’s desires, so that the
factories delivered desire to people in little everyday packages. They
were magnificently good at producing things you wanted – either things
you knew you wanted, or things you discovered you wanted the moment you
knew that they existed. Somehow their managers and designers thought
ahead of people’s wants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Galina’s outburst at the Sokolniki Park exhibit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She had never really had to think about the Americans before. They
were the villains in the story. She would have supposed that they would
seize this chance to tell a rival story, a counter-story, in which they
were the heroes. Instead they seemed to have come with no story; no
story beyond this untiring, universal brightness, this glow spreading
from every object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A poetic invocation of Marx’s vision of capitalism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But Marx had drawn a nightmare picture of what happened to human life
under capitalism, when everything was produced only in order to be
exchanged; when true qualities and uses dropped away, and the human
power of making and doing itself became only an object to be traded.
Then the makers and the things made turned alike into commodities, and
the motion of society turned into a kind of zombie dance, a grim
cavorting whirl in which objects and people blurred together till the
objects were half alive and the people were half dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then later Mokhov from Gosplan explaining to Emil the apprehension of
the Soviet bureaucrats in using machines to bring about Red Plenty:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We know the machine. We know how the parts connect – and they do all
connect, you know, they are all of a piece, the prices and the supply
system and the plan targets. They interlock. And we know that the thing
that stops the machine from seizing up is our ability to be pragmatic;
our discretion. What do you want to do? You want to take our discretion
away. You want the plan targets for ten thousand enterprises to come
straight out of the computer. And then there’d be no way of correcting
errors. Whatever mistakes were built into your prices would stay there,
locked in for ever, multiplying and multiplying until the machine shook
itself to pieces. No, thank you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A description of Khrushchev:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stalin had been a gangster who really believed he was a social
scientist. Khrushchev was a gangster who hoped he was a social
scientist. But the moment was drawing irresistibly closer when the
idealism would rot away by one more degree, and the Soviet Union would
be governed by gangsters who were only pretending to be social
scientists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inna Olegovna’s opinion of psychoprophylaxis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh, she knew this game. All her life it had been the cure-all.
Pretend the world better. If you weep, pretend you’re smiling. If you’re
puzzled, pretend you’re certain. If you’re hungry, pretend you’re full.
If you see chaos, pretend there’s a plan. If today stinks, pretend it’s
tomorrow. If it hurts – psychoprophylaxis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zoya breaking off her tryst with Kostya:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She had been married once and that was enough. She had liked
smuggling him in and out of the apartment at times when Max would not
have to meet him – snatching the two hours of Saturday afternoon when
Max was at the Young Inventors’ Club, and then going to pick him up,
secretly alive and awakened in her clothes, her lips a little puffy with
kissing, the taste of Kostya still in her mouth. He was not a braggart
or an oaf, and he had let her be gently educational. But they were at
different stages in their lives. He had wanted more than her spare
afternoons, he had wanted to be in love and to be loved back and for
what was happening between them to be the thing that set the story of
his life, or at least the story of that part of his life. It was
understandable. He was in his mid-twenties. He expected things to be
cumulative, to make sense. He expected events to cut an intelligible
figure in the air as they went by. And so she brought things quietly to
an end, so that he could go off and fall in love elsewhere; have, with
someone else, a passion with a narrative to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Khrushchev reflects in his dacha:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So much blood, and only one justification for it. Only one reason it
could have been all right to have done such things, and aided their
doing: if it had been all prologue, all only the last spasms in the
death of the old, cruel world, and the birth of the kind new one. But
without the work it was so much harder to believe. Without the work the
future had no heft to keep the past at bay. And the world went on the
same, so it seemed, unchanged, unredeemed, untransfigured. The same
things went on happening, the same old necessities bit just as hard.</p>
