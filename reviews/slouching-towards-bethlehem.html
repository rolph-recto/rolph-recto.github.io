<h1 class="title">Slouching Towards Bethlehem by Joan Didion</h1>
<p>January 23, 2022</p>
<p>I picked this up because of Joan Didion’s recent passing, and the
many obituaries and tributes to her that I read. Everyone was gushing
about her and unfailingly cited the sheer pleasure of reading her
writing. What can I say—the hype definitely met its expectations. I get
the feeling that her voice is eerily familiar, something that I have to
chalk up to her outsized influence. It feels like I have read so much of
her writing before because people have tried to copy her, consciously or
not. Who would not want to sound like her in these pages?</p>
<p>Montaigne, the originator of the form, comes off as someone who
writes to understand himself, so that his essays are full of the
ephemera that’s stuck in his head, passages of untranslated Latin and
Greek and all, a tour of a mind unsure of what to think. Reading an
essay by Didion gives the impression of someone completely sure of
herself, of someone with an exquisite eye for detail, someone who wants
to be part of the stories she is telling but reveals what she wants to
reveal about herself and nothing more. In Montaigne the agony of
thinking is on the page: with Didion all of it is scrubbed away, and her
famously cool and collected voice is all that is left in the
writing.</p>
<p>My favorite of these essays has to be, perhaps not surprisingly, the
title essay. Even after all this time it has the capacity to shock. What
I know of the hippies are mostly about the great psychedelic bands that
came from that era. However much they were romanticized, what she shows
is that the hippies were mainly teenage runaways, spending most of their
time doing drugs and idling about. There was not much love or peace in
what she depicts, and in fact she sees it as emblematic of a wider
social decay:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We were seeing the desperate attempt of a handful of pathetically
unequipped children to create a community in a social vacuum. Once we
had seen these children, we could no longer overlook the vacuum, no
longer pretend that the society’s atomization could be reversed. This
was not a traditional generational rebellion. At some point between 1945
and 1967 we had somehow neglected to tell these children the rules of
the game we happened to be playing. Maybe we had stopped believing in
the rules ourselves, maybe we were having a failure of nerve about the
game. Maybe there were just too few people around to do the telling.
These were children who grew up cut loose from the web of cousins and
great-aunts and family doctors and lifelong neighbors who had
traditionally suggested and enforced the society’s values. They are
children who have moved around a lot, San Jose, Chula Vista, here. They
are less in rebellion against the society than ignorant of it, able only
to feed back certain of its most publicized self-doubts, Vietnam,
Saran-Wrap, diet pills, the Bomb.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An interesting revelation from this collection is Joan Didion’s
conservatives streak. It’s clear that she was preoccupied with familiar
mainstays of the right: law and order and their dissolution, a reverence
towards American mythology (most exemplified by the John Wayne essay), a
skepticism of counterculture (as seen in the title essay and the one
about Joan Baez), the prizing of individual toughness (particularly in
the essay “Self-Respect”). This <em>Know Your Enemy</em> podcast <a
href="https://know-your-enemy-1682b684.simplecast.com/episodes/joan-didion-conservative-w-sam-tanenhaus">episode</a>
goes into much more detail about this, where they argue that this
conservatism comes from her roots in “old California” and her family
ancestry as frontierspeople—famously she was related to some of the
members to the doomed Donner Party. Of course she doesn’t dwell
explicitly much on politics here, if at all, but it adds an interesting
layer to an already idiosyncratic set of essays: there must be something
to the fact that her admirers are overwhelmingly liberal (as most
writers and aspiring writers today are) while here it is not clear at
all that she was.</p>
