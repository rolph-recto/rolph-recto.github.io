<h1 class="title">The Dispossessed by Ursula Le Guin</h1>
<p>December 28, 2022</p>
<p>As always, Le Guin’s worldbuilding is impeccable here. The
exploration of what an anarcho-syndicalist society would look like is
thorough and realistic; indeed, it is an “ambiguous” utopia as some
printings of the book make its subtitle to be. I especially enjoyed how
Le Guin manages to capture the psychology of someone who grows up in an
anarchist society, illustrated beautifully by Shevek’s horror at the
A-Io equivalent of 5th Avenue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the strangest thing about the nightmare street was that none of
the millions of things for sale were made there. They were only sold
there. Where were the workshops, the factories, where were the farmers,
the craftsmen, the miners, the weavers, the chemists, the carvers, the
dyers, the designers, the machinists, where were the hands, the people
who made? Out of sight, somewhere else. Behind walls. All the people in
all the shops were either buyers or sellers. They had no relation to the
things but that of possession.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whereas we (or a Soviet!<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>) would perhaps see the
“nightmare street” as a triumph, Shevek recoils at the sight of so much
abundance wrested away from its site of production, to be displayed only
as a commodity for consumption. Shevek’s horror is that on in Urras,
things are made to be sold; in Anarres, things are made to be used.</p>
<p>The psychology of dis-possession among the Anarresti extends not just
to material things but also to social relations. Particularly, the
nuclear family doesn’t seem to be the primary mode of social
organization (e.g. people live in “domiciles” that are basically
dormitories; Divlab assignments do not make exceptions to place partners
close to each other), though Shevek and Takver do display a great amount
of loyalty to each other. It’s not clear if abolishing the family is
something that Anarresti wholeheartedly embrace, as many characters
lament the difficulty in maintaining ties with partners.</p>
<p>What is most utopic about Anarresti society is their incredible
capacity for solidarity. For example, people basically follow Divlab
assignments no matter how inconvenient. (Also, Divlab’s global network
of job postings seems like a Soviet apparatchnik’s dream bureaucratic
tool than an anarchist’s; yet at the same time the postal service is so
bad people usually refrain from writing letters!) I think a large part
of this solidarity stems from the Odonian mythos, which gives the
Anarresti a unified culture, and from the Anarresti’s self-conception as
a hardscrabble people who take care of each other despite their hostile
environment.</p>
<p>At the same time, Le Guin is able to lob serious criticisms of
anarchist society. Particularly, power does not flow through a state in
an anarchist society; instead it is channeled through public opinion,
which through Shevek’s experience in ostracism Le Guin shows to be
capable of being oppressive as well. Of course one might sympathize with
the Anarresti would lash out at what Shevek is doing out of fear of the
Urrasti; but what about when public opinion turns on someone in
manifestly unreasonable ways—say, by being from a different culture, or
by being a different race? This is a situation where a state’s capacity
to enact coercion is useful: to act as a “referee” among citizens and
maintain order by making sure fundamental human rights are not violated.
By placing so much premium on freedom and voluntary association,
anarchist society does not have a response to minorities experiencing
prejudice beyond the consolation that they can always move somewhere
else. The Little Rock Five had to be escorted with police so that they
can go to school; if midcentury America was like Anarres, schools in the
South would still be segregated.</p>
<p>While the worldbuilding and the exploration of anarchism impeccable,
the plot is a bit muddled. Shevek basically doesn’t do anything in the
odd-numbered chapters covering his journey to Urras and eventual return
to Anarres, up until he decides to leave the University, where he
somehow immediately gets embroiled in an uprising against the A-Io
state. It reminds one of a car stuck in the mud which then, getting
traction, shoots off into the distance. The plot also just kind of ends
without much resolution: Shevek resolves to abandon working with A-Io
after realizing that he was basically jailed in the university, and
instead opts to work with the Terrans and the Hainish and come back to
Anarres. But the book ends as this shift is just beginning.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Compare Kruschev’s admiration of America in <em>Red
Plenty</em>: “But the Americans got it. Of all the capitalist countries,
it was America that hand-most nearly trying to do the same thing as the
Soviet Union. They shared the Soviet insight. They understood that
whittling and hand-stitching belonged to the past. They understood that
if ordinary people were to live the way the kings and merchants of old
had lived, what would be required was a new kind of luxury, an ordinary
luxury built up from goods turned out by the million so that everybody
could have one. And they were so good at it! The bulk fertility of their
industry was only the start. They had a kind of genius for lining up the
fruitfulness of mass production with people’s desires, so that the
factories delivered desire to people in little everyday packages. They
were magnificently good at producing things you wanted – either things
you knew you wanted, or things you discovered you wanted the moment you
knew that they existed. Somehow their managers and designers thought
ahead of people’s wants.”<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"
