<b>Rolph Recto</b> - <a href="/">Home</a>
<hr />
<h1 class="title">The Great Divorce by C. S. Lewis</h1>
<p>December 08, 2018</p>
<p>This is Lewis’s vision of the afterlife, and it is definitely the
best depiction I’ve come across. Hell is a town that stretches out for
millions of miles, encompassing the horizon, sparsely populated because
its residents want to be left alone in their loneliness. Heaven is a
dreamlike world full of nature and creatures of greater reality and
dimension than Hell (which is not even an atom in Heaven), so that
Hell’s residents are Ghosts in Heaven, unable even to pluck a blade of
grass from the fields.</p>
<p>Hell is not eternal torment in fire but, in Augustine’s words, the
“infolding of the Self.” Hell is the inability to surrender to the
greater reality beyond one’s own life and preoccupations. And, to this
atheist, this vision of Hell is something that I approve of. There is a
version of Christianity, removed from the attendant social institutions
that make it unpalatable, that converges with the deeper secular truths
about living that non-Christians (and other religions, most notably
Buddhism) stumble upon: that one’s suffering is proportional to the
dimensions of the Self in one’s attention. David Foster Wallace’s “This
is Water” speech comes plainest to describing this, and I think Lewis’s
vision here in this book, while obviously a Christian take, is
especially vivid. One’s life takes on a largeness and firmer reality
once we have abandoned our “skull-sized kingdoms,” in Wallace’s words,
and to simply pay attention and give the play of everyday life its due.
It is very hard, like fish trying to remind itself that it is swimming
in water:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because here’s something else that’s weird but true: in the day-to
day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism.
There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only
choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe
choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship – be it JC
or Allah, be it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble
Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles – is that pretty
much anything else you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money
and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you
will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It’s the truth.
Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel
ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths
before they finally grieve you. On one level, we all know this stuff
already. It’s been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, epigrams,
parables; the skeleton of every great story. The whole trick is keeping
the truth up front in daily consciousness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know this is isn’t Lewis’s purpose for writing The Great Divorce,
that above all it is a piece of Christian apologetics, and, specifically
as he describes in the preface, a justification for non-universalism.
But, being not a Christian, that is not what I care about. The vision of
Heaven that he presents is beautiful, and, importantly to me, attainable
only by surrender of the Self.</p>
