<h1 class="title">The MANIAC by Benjamin Labatut</h1>
<p>April 18, 2024</p>
<p>A worthy successor to Labatut’s debut <em>When We Cease to Understand
the World</em>, this is a three-part novel about Paul Ehrenfest, John
von Neumann, and Lee Sedol’s match with AlphaGo. The von Neumann
sections form the bulk of the book (as the title implies, since MANIAC
is the name of the computer designed by von Neumann at IAS), and
definitely the most compelling. Labatut’s depiction of von Neumann as a
genius manchild—the foremost of the Hungarian “Martians” who left an
indelible mark on twentieth century science—brings the him down to earth
as a man of startling duality. The man who immediately understood the
implications of Godel’s presentation of his incompleteness theorems is
also the same man who does not understand his wife; the man who
co-invented game theory with Oskar Morgenstern is the same man who
gleefully proposed a preemptive nuclear strike against the Soviet
Union.</p>
<p>Perhaps von Neumann is the starkest example of the seductive powers
of science and technology, how our pursuit of their advancement in the
extreme, to the detriment of everything else, betrays a kind of
atavistic impulse born from something beyond reason. Wigner’s depiction
of von Neumann’s spiritual turn at the end of his life brings this
home:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We were stunted in all arts except for one, techne, where our wisdom
had become so profound and dangerous that it would have made the Titans
that terrorized the Earth cower in fear, and the ancient lords of the
woods seem as puny as sprites and as quaint as pixies. Their world was
gone. So now science and technology would have to provide us with a
higher version of ourselves, an image of what we could become.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In making technologies of terrible power, we made ourselves gods—John
von Neumann foremost among us. And yet even at death’s door, something
we must all pass, he “behaved like a child, as if death was something
that only happened to others, something that he had never really
considered and so was completely unprepared for.” There is something
noble about this childishness, as it means that he never resigned
himself to limits that most of us would have already accepted. But it is
a childishness all the same. So even von Neumann, god as he is, remains
a puny, pathetic god.</p>
