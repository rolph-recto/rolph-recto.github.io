<h1 class="title">The Power Broker by Robert Caro</h1>
<p>October 05, 2024</p>
<p>This book lived up to the hype. It’s meticulous yet engaging; it’s
about deathly serious matters like slum clearance and yet hilarious at
points (LaGuardia writing up a form for the next time Moses threatened
to quit; Wagner being clowned by the newspapers for failing to find and
talk to his Park Commissioner during the Battle of Central Park). It’s
got everything. There are minor complaints—Caro repeats himself, takes
liberties with chronology so that it’s hard to tell when things exactly
happened—but none diminish the accomplishment. As people have said, the
book has become a New York establishment, much like Moses himself.</p>
<p>The central question is, of course, how Robert Moses got all that
power (at one point, twelve simultaneous appointments in state and city
offices). Part of the answer is that Moses “Got Things Done”—he was
fiercely intelligent, workaholic, and ruthless at eliminating obstacles
that impeded his projects. He carefully cultivated a public image of
himself as a selfless public servant who wanted nothing more than to
build parks and other amenities for everyone, and he was skillful at
manipulating the press whenever some revelation might tarnish that
image.</p>
<p>From a higher, systems-oriented vantage, the other reason for his
iron grip on power is that Moses organized corruption in New York City
to flow through him. His empire, built from the nickels and dimes from
toll fare to cross Triborough’s bridges and tunnels, had something for
everyone: vast (and therefore visible to the regular voter) public works
for city officials eager to add something to their resumes in time for
the next election cycle; underwriting fees and interest payments for the
bankers buying and handling Triborough Authority bonds; jobs to dole out
to the Tammany machine; construction opportunities big enough to keep
the ranks of labor unions working. Moses made himself indispensible to
powerful people, and from this his power stems.</p>
<p>Moses’ arrogance, despite his unparalleled track record of
construction projects, makes his legacy Janus-faced. He had an
unparalleled ability to build parks, playgrounds, bridges, highways, and
so much more; but the way he did so made him unable to take criticism or
really any meaningful input from others, his literal deafness in his
later years being a rather apt physical manifestation of his staggering
arrogance. Despite the warnings from many people that his car-oriented
highway projects would make the traffic problem in the New York
metropolitan area worse, Moses refused to integrate mass transit in his
projects; and such warnings became prophecies that have only been proven
truer and truer ever since.</p>
<p>As well, Moses’ elitism and disdain for the poor made him callous
towards the destruction he wrought upon the residents of New York City.
He found no object to destroying thriving neighborhoods like Sunset Park
in Brooklyn and East Tremont in the Bronx to make way for his highways,
as he did not see them as such, only as “slums” that stand his in way.
His mismanagement of Title I slum clearance projects enriched his
cronies in at the expense of evicting thousands of residents out of
affordable apartments, whom he falsely promised a smooth resettlement
process into new, similarly affordable residences.</p>
<p>Because of this arrogance and callousness, it is not hard to see
Moses as a villain, a cautionary tale of what happens when a very
capable and ruthless person acquires immense power. But times have
changed. There is a sense that ours is a sclerotic and <a
href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Decadent-Society/Ross-Douthat/9781476785257">decadent</a>
society, that things are slowly falling apart and we have forgotten how
to <a href="https://a16z.com/its-time-to-build/">build</a>. We cannot
build enough <a
href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/housing/problem/problem.page">housing</a>;
we cannot build <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_High-Speed_Rail">railroads</a>;
we let other countries <a
href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-opinion-how-us-lost-solar-power-race-to-china/">leap
ahead of us</a> in important future technologies. Because of this, weary
as we might be to let someone like Moses run roughshod over our cities
again, Ross Barkan cautions in a <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/opinion/the-power-broker-robert-moses.html">recent
op-ed</a> that we must resist to “overlearn” the lessons of <em>The
Power Broker</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Still, as megalomaniacal as Mr. Moses could be, he proved the public
sector could be a tangible force for civic improvement in America,
delivering monumental public works that could stand for the rest of the
century and beyond.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it’s not clear what to make of this sentiment. Our public
officials (at least some) <em>do</em> have <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_New_Deal">grand ambitions</a>,
and see the government as a force for good. So what Barkan might fondly
look back on Moses’ career is his unparalleled track record of
delivering on his ambitions. But we must remember that Moses’s success
is inextricable from his bullying personality. Even if he could stand to
be less brusque, his deafness to the concerns of others and his ability
to navigate around people’s opposition to his projects is what made him
such an effective builder. We can wait for the second coming of Moses to
break through the red tape of bureaucracy and deliver us monumental
public works again, but is that what we really want—someone who knows
how to pull the levers of power so that they can impose their designs on
us, whatever we might think of them?</p>
<p>I am reminded of the old quip from Churchill, that democracy is the
worst form of government, except for all the other forms that have been
tried. The ability for people to challenge public projects is an
important lever of democracy, one that Moses ignored and fought hard
against, to great success. No doubt, this lever can be <a
href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-01-30/editorial-ceqa-is-too-easily-weaponized-to-block-housing-and-slow-environmental-progress">weaponized</a>;
but on the whole, perhaps preserving this ability is worth the price of
not being able to build on the scale that Moses did. Yes, we can do with
being less sclerotic, with some cutting of red tape, but we do not need
to romanticize a man whose wildly successful career was built on the
inability to hear anyone but himself.</p>
