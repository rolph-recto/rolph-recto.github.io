<h1 class="title">The Trial by Franz Kafka</h1>
<p>December 07, 2018</p>
<p>I think when people describe something as “kafkaesque”, they really
are refering to this book. I remember reading The Metamorphosis in high
school and not quite seeing the fit between the use of the adjective and
the story: Gregor Samsa’s transformation isn’t really about some kind of
external force (the Court’s bureaucracy) that impinges on him but rather
the internal anguish that he feels. The externality of the Court is I
think the most important difference between The Metamorphosis and The
Trial, and it is what distinguishes the latter as being the best
representative of what is “kafkaesque”: only that which is outside of
you can be simultaneously all-powerful and mysterious.</p>
<p>What makes this novel stand out to me is its unrelenting ambiguity. I
don’t think I have read something whose story is just so peripheral:
Josef K. never develops to learn more about what crime he is accused of;
he does not develop or change as a character; at the end he just dies
unceremoniously. If you can draw the arc of the plot, it would be a
straight line, with Josef K. stumbling from one surreal encounter after
another, his life being circumscribed more and more tightly by the Court
but, as the man from the country in the priest’s parable, never getting
past the first door of the Law. The lack of resolution is jarring and
frustrating but also simultaneously exhiliarating, as if it is the
discovery of a new language for telling stories, stories that don’t have
arcs or resolutions but precisely for that lack conveys a blinding
truth.</p>
<p>It would be easy to find interpretations of this novel that purport
to draw its intended meaning. I would be most partial I think to some
kind of Freudian interpretation, but interpretation is exactly what
destroys the ambiguity that I enjoy about The Trial so much. I find
Kafka’s work fascinating because he takes the world as it is and
transmutes it just so, just makes it fantastical enough to convey a
feeling so vividly – and more than anything, more than any kind of
political or psychological point you can extract from this book, this
sense of dread and anxiety and unknowing is what sticks to the mind.
(And like most good art, its main contribution is sensory, not
propositional.) It isn’t hard to see why Garcia-Marquez finds
inspiration in him, and why you can take him to be a precursor to the
magical realists.</p>
