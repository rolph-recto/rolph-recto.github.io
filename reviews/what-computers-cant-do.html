<h1 class="title">What Computers Can’t Do by Hubert Dreyfus</h1>
<p>January 02, 2016</p>
<p>I’ve finally gotten around to reading this famous book, and I have to
say that its fame is quite merited. This is one of the best examples
I’ve come across of philosophy interacting with its neighboring
scientific disciplines. Unlike say, Dennett, however, Dreyfus writes not
in the perspective of a fellow researcher who tries to perform some
philosophical examination of a thorny problem within the discipline, but
rather in the perspective of an outsider who wants to rectify the
outsized claims of researchers in a fledgling field. So it’s easy to
understand why he was so excoriated by AI people in the past.</p>
<p>However, the book is not actually as negative as one would think,
especially in light of the fact that for Dreyfus the failure of AI is
nothing less than <em>an empirical refutation of a philosophical
doctrine that is deeply entrenched in the Western tradition</em>:
namely, the epistemological assumption that everything can be described
by formal, context-free rules, and the ontological assumption that the
world consists of independent, context-free facts<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. In
fact, he attempts to categorize intelligent behavior to pinpoint the
types of tasks that AI would be <em>successful</em> in (from Type I
tasks that involve only associationistic reasoning, up to Type III tasks
that involve formal rules that in principle can be performed by a
computer but whose complexity requires the use of heuristics), and of
course to pinpoint also the types of tasks with which it would not fare
so well (Type IV tasks that require nonformal reasoning and context
sensitivity, such as understanding natural language).</p>
<p>While his criticisms of the symbolist paradigm is spot on, I am less
enthusiastic about the alternative paradigm that he outlines in Part
III. Probably this stems from the fact that I don’t have much of a
background in phenomenology, so the reading in this section was harder
going. As a first impression, I can see why Edward Feigenbaum would call
this “cotton candy”—but for different reasons. “To the things
themselves,” as Husserl says, means the attempt to theorize about
everyday reasoning experience; but at the same time the force of
Dreyfus’s arguments against symbolist AI adumbrate the very
impossibility of this task. So there seems to be a self-defeating air
about this part of the book. But at the very least, I think it’s a
better foundation for understanding human cognition than symbolist
AI.</p>
<p>It is interesting to read this book over forty years after it was
first published. Of course AI as a field has changed quite a bit since
that time, so Dreyfus’s text has some glaring omissions, the most
important of which is the discussion of machine learning. I am not sure
how well Dreyfus’s arguments would extend to this subfield of AI. On one
hand, it does not share the epistemic and ontological assumptions of
symbolist AI. Machine learning algorithms need not assume that the
regularities of the world can be captured in or, more strongly, consists
of independent facts whose relations can be captured in context-free
rules; they only assume that the world has regularities at all, which
can be studied as a black box using probability and statistics. However,
my hunch is that Dreyfus’s assessment of machine learning would be
similarly negative as of his assessment of symbolist AI unless it
integrated an “embodied” approach, which would require insights from
robotics<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<section id="footnotes" class="footnotes footnotes-end-of-document"
role="doc-endnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>It is easiest to see the force of Dreyfus’s criticisms
in light of, say, the logical positivists. But his claim that the entire
tradition, from Socrates up to (but not including) Wittgenstein and
Heidegger is party to these assumptions seems to me a stretch. However,
I think this is not really crucial to Dreyfus’s central points, as he
only connects the philosophical underpinnings of symbolist AI with these
assumptions to draw a contrast with the alternative “embodied”
paradigm.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>His negative remarks concerning Watson, the AI that won
Jeopardy! against Ken Jennings, seem to vindicate this hunch. See his
piece on the Times <a
href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/28/watson-still-cant-think/">here</a>,
where he constrasts Watson with the more embodied approach by the
“subsumption architecture” that Rodney Brooks pioneered in robotics.<a
